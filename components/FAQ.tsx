    {
        question: "What do you actually do?",
        answer: "Iâ€™ve probably been asked that more times than my own name. I build custom websites and software that solve real problems. Think of me as a digital architect, I design the blueprint, write the code, and make sure everything works beautifully. Whether it's an e-commerce store, a booking system, or a complex web app, I create solutions that are fast, functional, and designed to grow with your business."
    },
    {
        question: "Why the name 'Devdactyl'?",
        answer: "I was <em>that</em> dinosaur kid. While other girls played with dolls, I was reading about the Jurassic period and collecting fossils. I've got a pterodactyl tooth on my desk right now (yes, really). So 'Devdactyl' is a mashup of 'DEVeloper' and 'pterodactyl' - a nod to my childhood obsession. Sure, dinosaurs didn't last forever... but your website will live on in the memories just like them. ðŸ¦–"
    },
    {
        question: "Do you only build websites?",
        answer: "Nope! I also develop custom software, integrate APIs, automate the boring repetitive stuff, and set up cloud hosting that doesn't crash when people visit your site. I just happen to have developed a massive crush on front-end design and playing with animations. But backend, DevOps, databases? I've got you covered there too."
    },
    {
        question: "Do you offer maintenance or support?",
        answer: "Absolutely. I've spent enough time on dating apps in my time to know how bad ghosting feels, so I <strong>don't disappear after launch</strong>. If you want ongoing updates, security patches, backups, and those little improvements that keep your site running smoothly, I offer maintenance plans. Your site will never be left on read."
    },
    {
        question: "Can you fix my existing website?",
        answer: "Yes! Whether it's broken, slow, outdated, or just kinda ugly, I can diagnose the issues and get it back in shape. Think of it as a digital renovation. I'll assess what's salvageable, what needs rebuilding, and give you an honest plan. No judgment."
    },
    {
        question: "Do you use AI to build websites?",
        answer: "I use AI as a tool, not a crutch. It's great for speeding up boring tasks or writing boilerplate code. But the strategy, design decisions, custom functionality, and that final polish? That's all human. AI can't understand your brand or what makes your business unique. I can."
    },
    {
        question: "How long does it take to build a website?",
        answer: "It depends on complexity, but here's the rough timeline: a simple brochure site takes 1-3 weeks, a custom business site with integrations could take 3-6 weeks, and a full web app or e-commerce platform can be up to 8-12 weeks. I'll give you a realistic estimate after our initial chat."
    },
    {
        question: "Do you work with clients outside Ireland?",
        answer: "100%. I've worked with clients from Ireland to the Cayman Islands and beyond. Thanks to the magic of the internet (and a brain that was never wired to sleep), time zones are just a minor inconvenience. If you've got a project and a solid WiFi connection, we can make it happen."
    },
    {
        question: "How much does a website cost?",
        answer: "The dreaded question! It ranges from â‚¬500 for a simple site or fix to â‚¬10,000+ for complex custom builds. Every project is different, so I don't have a one-size-fits-all price list. After a quick discovery call, I'll send you a transparent, detailed quote with no hidden fees. You'll know exactly what you're paying for."
    },
    // {
    //     question: "What's your design process like?",
    //     answer: "We start with a discovery session to understand your goals, audience, and brand vibe. Then I create wireframes and mockups for your feedback. Once we nail the design, I move into development, keeping you in the loop with regular check-ins. Before launch, we test everything, and then I hand over a polished, ready-to-go site (plus training if you need it)."
    // },
    // {
    //     question: "Can you help with SEO and online marketing?",
    //     answer: "I build sites with SEO best practices baked in â€” clean code, fast loading, mobile-friendly, proper meta tags, and semantic HTML. For ongoing SEO strategy, content marketing, or paid ads, I can recommend trusted specialists I've worked with. I focus on building the foundation; they help you dominate the search results."
